# Research On Music Generation Using Brain Waves:

> ## there are many levels to this data.

> ## a. we first need to understand what kind of different neuro waves are there.

### → Neuro waves are basically classified based on there frequencies ranges:<br>-Delta(<4Hz) - Slowest, usually seen during deep sleep,<br>-Theta(4-8Hz) - Slow, usually seen during drowsiness,<br>-Alpha(8-13Hz) - Relaxed but awake,<br>-Beta(13-30Hz) - Alert, focused thinking and problem solving,<br>-Gamma(30-100Hz) - fastest,usually seen during high mental activity.

<br>

> ## b. what can be measured by the present sensors.

### → EEG-Electrodes can measure electrical activity (changes in voltage levels) of different positions of brain.<br><br>EMG-Electrodes: Motor neurons transmit electrical signals that cause muscles to contract. An EMG uses tiny devices called electrodes to translate these signals into graphs, sounds or numerical values.<br>More on :https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7037130/#B52-sensors-20-00592

> ## c. what waves are related to what kind of processes & emotions.

### → Gamma waves (30-100 Hz): High cognitive processing, perception, and consciousness.<br>Beta waves (12-30 Hz): Alertness, concentration, and active thinking.<br>Alpha waves (8-12 Hz): Relaxation, calmness, and a sense of well-being.<br>Theta waves (4-8 Hz): Drowsiness, meditation, and deep relaxation.<br>Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz): Deep sleep and unconsciousness.
